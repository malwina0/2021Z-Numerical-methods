## Project 1
Finding roots of polynomials of the form $$w(z) = \sum_{k=0}^{n} a_{k}z^{k}$$ in the complex domain using Jarrat method. Visualization of convergence of each starting point using color according to the number of iterations needed to converge. Horner's algorithm used to calculate the value of the polynomial and its derivative.

## Project 2
Solving the matrix equation $AX = B$ in the complex domain using the Cholesky-Banachiewicz method ( $LDL^{H}$ decomposition), where $A$ is Hermitian, positively defined, tridiagonal matrix.
